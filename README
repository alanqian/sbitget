Description
    This tool extract bitmap data from a TrueType font file
    to BDF-format text files.  

    TrueType files that embedded bitmap data are limited.
    The author found 'Lucida Console' (lucon.ttf) in
    Windows98 is the one.

    TrueTypeCollection (TTC) files are not supported,  but
    you can divide one TTC file into some TTF files with
    ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/drg/truetype/ttsdk.zip

    Pronounce 'es bit get'.
    'sbit' means the TrueTypeFont term, 'Scaler Bitmap'.

How to compile and install
    $ gcc -O2 sbitget.c -o sbitget
    $ su
    # cp sbitget /usr/local/bin


Caution 
    Output BDF-format files are NOT a real BDF file.
    Character-code information and glyph's encoding numbers
    are missing in these files.
    ( 'glyphID:xxxx' means index numbers in the TrueType font.
       In TrueType fonts,  'cmap' table combines TrueType's
       index numbers with glyph's encoding numbers.
       This software don't read 'cmap' table.)
